Gonna write my test in the following format:

Component this applies to:
  What the test should look out for

---------------

<input>:
  Should have "type" attribute

<input type="submit"> OR <button> used for submitting:
  Should have an alert built in when button is clicked (??? not sure how to do this other than looking for onClick function)
  This one also doesn't apply to all forms (example: login)'

<input>:
  should have a <label> associated with input with "for/id" attributes describing what is expected in the input

<input>:
  should have corresponding "autocomplete" attribute if "type" is something like: tel, email, bday, etc.

<input>:
  should have "placeholder" attribute
  or not? https://www.deque.com/blog/accessible-forms-the-problem-with-placeholders/



  -might be able to accomplish some alerts with reactive statements
  -preventDefault() for forms may be useful
